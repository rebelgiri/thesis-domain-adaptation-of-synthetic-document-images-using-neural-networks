Neural networks have improved significantly in past decades. They are competent to solve complex problems in the field of deep learning. Also, they are capable to handle a large amount of data. However, the training of neural networks requires a significantly large amount of annotated data, which is not always possible. It is inevitable to machine learning engineers have to generate synthetic data. Nevertheless, the neural networks trained on synthetic data will not able to perform or generalize well on real data. In recent years, an effective technique named domain adaptation has evolved to address the problem of lack of annotated data. The domain adaptation technique can transform data from one domain to another domain. For example, domain adaptation techniques like image-to-image translation can be used to transform images of zebras into images of horses and vice-versa. In this thesis, the image-to-image translation application is implemented using \ac{CycleGAN}. \ac{CycleGAN} is evolved variant of \ac{GAN}. It is an unsupervised image-to-image translation method which learns to transform an image from a source domain to a target domain in the absence of paired examples and annotated data.  The objective of the thesis is to improve document image classification and reduce the scarcity of annotated data.  This application attempts to close the domain gap between synthetic data distribution and real data distribution by generating realistic document images from synthetic document images using \ac{CycleGAN}. These realistic document images can be used to train a classifier to classify real document images further. This process accelerates the process of annotating new real document images and the scarcity of annotated data can be reduced. In this thesis, several experiments are performed to understand the domain gap between  data distributions. Experimental results show generated data distribution matched comparably better to real data distribution than synthetic data distribution and faxified data distribution. With the obtained results during the experiments, it can be said a large number of realistic document images can be generated using \ac{CycleGAN} to resolve the problem of scarcity of data in the target domain to improve the performance of document image classification models. This thesis only discusses a \ac{CycleGAN} to solve the problem defined in this thesis. The rest of the methods and comparisons with them are left for future work.  Also, \ac{CycleGAN} can be used for generating realistic images in many tasks like image classification, segmentation, object detection, reconstruction, etc. The aim of this thesis is limited to improve the document image classification due to time constraints.
