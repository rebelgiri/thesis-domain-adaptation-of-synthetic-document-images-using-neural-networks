Neural networks have improved significantly in past decades. They are competent to solve complex problems in the field of deep learning, and they are capable to manage a large amount of complex data like images, videos, and sound. However, the training of neural networks requires a significantly large amount of annotated data, which is not always possible. Machine learning engineers inevitably have to generate synthetic data. Although, the neural networks trained on synthetic data will not able to perform or generalize well on real data. In recent years, an effective technique named domain adaptation has evolved, to address the problem of scarcity of annotated data. The domain adaptation technique can transform data from the source domain to the target domain. For example, domain adaptation techniques like image-to-image translation can be used to transform images of zebras into images of horses and vice-versa. This thesis proposes an image-to-image translation application that aims to close the domain gap between synthetic data distribution and real data distribution using \acp{CycleGAN}. The proposed application is used to transform synthetic document images into realistic document images, to reduce the scarcity of annotated real document images. Further, these generated realistic document images are can be used to train classifiers to classify similar unlabeled real document images to speed up the process of labeling images in an unsupervised, automated manner. Experimental results show the generated realistic document images are qualitatively convincing and quantitatively needs improvement. Such initial results suggest \ac{CycleGAN} can solve the problem of data scarcity by generating quality images in the target domain. The aim of this thesis is limited to improve the document image classification. Once abundant data is generated in the target domain ultimately the performance of a real document image classifier can be improved. Due to time constraints, this thesis work is limited only to investigate \ac{CycleGAN} an image-to-image translation method in the absence of paired training data. The remaining methods and comparisons with them are left for future work. In the future, \ac{CycleGAN} can be used for generating realistic images in many tasks like handwriting recognition, image classification, image segmentation, object detection, and object reconstruction.

In this thesis, the image-to-image translation application is implemented using \ac{CycleGAN}. \ac{CycleGAN} is evolved variant of \ac{GAN}. It is an unsupervised image-to-image translation method which learns to transform an image from a source domain to a target domain in the absence of paired and annotated training data. The objectives of this thesis are to generated realistic images, reduce the scarcity of annotated images. These generated realistic document images are possibly used to train a classifier to classify unseen real document images. Furthermore, it speeds up the process of labeling images in an unsupervised, automated manner. This application attempts to close the domain gap between synthetic data distribution and real data distribution by generating realistic document images by transforming synthetic document images using \ac{CycleGAN}. Experimental results show the generated realistic document images are qualitatively convincing and can be improved further. Quantitatively document images that are faxified using faxfication tool slightly match the real data distribution. Such initial promising results, it can be said \ac{CycleGAN} can be used to resolve the problem of scarcity of data in the target domain. The aim of this thesis is limited to improve the document image classification. Once abundant data is generated in the target domain ultimately the performance of a real document image classifier can be improved. In this thesis, we are limiting ourselves to only one method of image-to-image translation due to time constraints. The rest of the methods and comparisons with them are left for future work. Also, \ac{CycleGAN} can be used for generating realistic images in many tasks like handwriting recognition, image classification, segmentation, object detection, reconstruction, etc.


%Experimental results show generated data distribution matched comparably better to real data distribution than synthetic data distribution and faxified data distribution. With the obtained results during the experiments, it can be said a large number of realistic document images can be generated using \ac{CycleGAN} to resolve the problem of scarcity of data in the target domain to improve the performance of document image classification models.
