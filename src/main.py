# Create Synthetic document images
# Load all the synthetic document images in array along with labels.
# Evaluate the on the real annotated data
# Classifier for synthetic document images
# CycleGAN for domain adaptation
# Classify adapted synthetic document images
# evaluate the new classifier again on the real annotated data
